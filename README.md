        I'm Sheep a computer science student and a networking enthusiast from Spain!<br>
        I really really like networking related stuff, I try to learn something new every day about it.<br>
        Currently learning about kernel in C!        
        Open to collaborating on interesting and innovative projects.<br>
        Still learning this langs, anyways I only release code that 100% works or that I think is good enough.<br>
